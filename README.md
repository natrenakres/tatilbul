No installation is required for the project. Go to the [Chat](https://tatilbul.site) page, type an input about the vacation you want, and save the answer if needed, or start a new chat.

The project is not dependent on the **Cohere** model. Thanks to LangChain.js, it can create model-independent prompts.
